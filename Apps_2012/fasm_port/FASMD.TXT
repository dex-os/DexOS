1  Introduction
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The FASMD.EXE is a version of flat assembler integrated into editor
environment capable of editing many file at once (limited only by the
available memory) and compiling and running programs created this way
directly from inside the IDE. The editor also uses the simple syntax
highlighting based on the same algorithms as used by flat assembler itself.


2  System requirements
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The DOS IDE version of flat assembler requires an OS compatible with MS DOS
with a DPMI server available, compliant at least to DPMI 0.9 specification.
It also requires a color video adapter compatible with VGA.
  The editor runs in text mode and it tries to preserve the mode that was set
outside of it (so you can even switch a mode by writing simple program doing
it and executing it from inside the IDE), however it won't accept text modes
with less than 80 columns.


3  Keyboard commands in editor
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This section lists the all keyboard commands available when working with
editor. Except for the keys listed as specific ones, they are common with the
Win32 IDE for flat assembler.

  Movement:

    Left arrow            move one character left
    Right arrow           move one character right
    Up arrow              move one line up
    Down arrow            move one line down
    Ctrl+Left arrow       move one word left
    Ctrl+Right arrow      move one word right
    Home                  move to the beginning of line
    End                   move to the end of line
    PageUp                move one page up
    PageDown              move one page down

4  Working with windows
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To switch between controls in a dialog window use either arrow keys or Tab.
With Enter you accept the information you have entered or selected, with Esc
you abort the operation. To switch the check-box use Space key.
  In the ASCII table window you may navigate with arrow keys or select a
character by entering it from keyboard. With Esc you can exit the table without
any additional operation, pressing Enter or Ctrl+B puts the selected character
into the text.


5  Editor options
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

In the window that shows up when you press F10 key you may turn on and off
some of the editor options. The available options are:

  Secure selection - when you turn this option on, the selected block never
gets deleted when you start typing. When you do any text-changing operation,
the selection is cancelled, not affecting in any way the text that was
selected, and then the command is performed. When this option is off and you
start typing, the current selection is discarded, also Del key simply deletes
the selected block (when secure selection is on you have to use Ctrl+Del).

  Automatic brackets - when you type any of the opening brackets, the closing
one is automatically put just after caret.

  Automatic indents - when you press Enter to start a new line, the caret is
moved into the new line at the same position, where in the previous line the
first non-blank character is placed. If you are breaking the line, and there
were some non-blank characters after the caret when you pressed Enter, they
are moved into the new line at the position of indent, any blank characters
that were between the caret and them are ignored.

  Smart tabulation - when you press Tab, it moves you to the position just
below the next sequence of non-blank characters in the line above starting
from the position just above where you were. If no such sequence is found in
line above, the standard tabulation size of 8 characters is used.

  Optimal fill on saving - with this option enabled, when the file is saved,
all blank areas are filled with the optimal combination of tabs and spaces to
get the smaller file size. If this option is off, the blank areas are saved as
filled with spaces (but the spaces at the ends of lines are not saved).


6  Configuration
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The editor options are automatically stored in the configuration file (which
has the same name as the executable file, but with the .INI extension).
But there are some settings you can configure only by editing this file
directly.
  It is possible to adjust the colors used by the IDE by adding the
appropriate settings into the configuration file (when it does not contain
such settings, the default colors are used). The color values are the indexes
into the 16-color palette used by the text mode of video adapter. The section 
of configuration file containing color definitions identical to the default 
settings would look like:

  [Colors]
  Text=7
  Background=8
  SelectionText=15
  SelectionBackground=7
  Symbols=15
  Numbers=10
  Strings=12
  Comments=3

  StatusText=15
  StatusBackground=2

  WindowText=15
  WindowBackground=3
  BoxText=15
  BoxBackground=1
  BoxSelectionText=15
  BoxSelectionBackground=9

  MessageText=15
  MessageBackground=3
  MessageSelectionText=15
  MessageSelectionBackground=1

  ErrorText=14
  ErrorBackground=4
  ErrorSelectionText=14
  ErrorSelectionBackground=6

  The section "Compiler" may be contain the "Memory" option, declaring the
maximum amount of kilobytes of memory that assembler is allowed to allocate
for compilation (by default it uses all available physical memory), and the
"Passes" option, setting the maximum allowed number of passes over the 
source (the default value is 100, the maximum value is 65536).
  It is also possible to define environment variables through the configuration
file, by putting them into the section called "Environment" - this way one 
can define the environment variables visible only to the flat assembler, 
instead of defining them globally in the operating system.
